=======================

(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I¡¯m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
treasure hunt is a game where you look for treasure in a randomly generated world.

b) as a player i can walk up and down the screen finding treasure and that's about it.

c) it runs, but it seems pretty boring

d) one could add enemies that guard treasure on the map, or maybe traps that the player has to avoid, or maybe add weapons for the player to find and use against specific enemies, or even add side-scrolling functionality for the map to make the game more interesting.

e) readme is decent, but could perhaps look prettier

f) build.xml looks pretty well documented and clean

g) yes there are so many we are so excited

h) i have not added any as most of the issues i thought of are listed

i) there are only 5 classes, so if we want to expand the game we will need to refactor the class hierarchy. The purposes of the classes and their methods are pretty clear, and so are their relations to one another
