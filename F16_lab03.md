#Lisa L. and Patrick V.

(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I'm looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
* Treasure Hunter is a game where the player walks around a grassy map looking for treasure.

(b) (20 pts) A set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
* As a player I can walk up and down the map and find treasure. That's really it there is nothing more to this.

(c) (20 pts) A brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does
* Treasure Hunter runs, but is dreadfully boring.

(d) (20 pts) A set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
* Add enemies that guard treasure
* Add traps for the player to avoid
* Add weapons for the player to find and use 
* Expand the map
* Add more interesting terrain elements
* Messages look ugly and kind of unnecessary???
* This might be kind of crazy but what if we use LWJGL for graphics :o

(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
* README.md is decent content-wise, but could benefit from some nicer formatting and punctuation.

(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
* build.xml looks pretty well documented and clean. All targets have descriptions and make sense

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
* The issues mostly focus on improving the functionality of the existing code, rather than adding brand new features. The issues are clear as 

(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
* Most of the issues I thought of are actually already existing issues, so I didn't add any new ones.

(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
* There are only 5 classes, so if we want to expand the game we will need to refactor the class hierarchy. 
* Class relations are pretty obvious, especially since there are just 3 main ones to consider.
* The code isn't too bad, we had an easy time understanding most of it.
* For my one screenful of text I would explain the main relationships between GameComponent, Player, and GameGui.

(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
* There are JUnit tests for class Player but not for anything else. We could expand test coverage by making tests for all the existing classes and their eventual child-classes. The way I would go about it is solidify the existing functionality and dig for any hidden bugs, then expand the tests based on the new classes we'll eventually start implementing.
