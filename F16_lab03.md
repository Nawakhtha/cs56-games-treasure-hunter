#Lisa L. and Patrick V.

(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I¡¯m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
* treasure hunt is a game where you look for treasure in a randomly generated world.

(b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
* as a player i can walk up and down the screen finding treasure and that's about it.

(c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does
* it runs, but it seems pretty boring

(d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
* one could add enemies that guard treasure on the map, or maybe traps that the player has to avoid, or maybe add weapons for the player to find and use against specific enemies, or even add side-scrolling functionality for the map to make the game more interesting.

(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
* readme is decent, but could perhaps look prettier

(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
* build.xml looks pretty well documented and clean

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
* yes there are so many we are so excited

(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
* i have not added any as most of the issues i thought of are listed

(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
* there are only 5 classes, so if we want to expand the game we will need to refactor the class hierarchy. The purposes of the classes and their methods are pretty clear, and so are their relations to one another

(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
